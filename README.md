# Customer Retention

#

### Aims

The aim of this project is to:

- Analyse Churn dataset
- Analyze how the different features affect retention or customer churn
- Compare Python and SQL techniques 

#

### Data

The [dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/adammaus/predicting-churn-for-bank-customers) used for this project was obtained from Kaggle. It contains data about customers who are withdrawing their account from a bank.


### Files

This repo contains the following files:

- A jupyter notebook named `churn_analysis.ipynb` containing the exploratory data analysis, feature engineering, search for the best model, evaluations of the best models found, as well as the analysis of the feature importance.  

- SQL queries to do the same in BigQuery: `churn_analysis.sql`

- A CSV file named `Churn.csv` which contains the data from the bank customers
